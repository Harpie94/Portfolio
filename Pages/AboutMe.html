									<p>
										1st of, my real name is Romain (I won't give my 1st name like that tho) and I LOVE video games (creating them or playing them).
										<br> I began using a computer very early (at like 7) and loved what I saw and was always interested in the video game world.
										<br> In my last 2 year of High School we learnt on how to do electronics with some Arduinos in C and I quite enjoyed it, in that same High School I got my Baccalaureate Degree in STI2D SIN to be more precise and then began my 1st year at Gaming Campus.
										<br> During those 3 years at GC we learnt quite a bit, mainly C and C++, but learning Unity and Unreal Engine really got me interested.
										<br> Each year we got to create 1 big game as an "end of year project", 1st year we did a Side Scroller in Python, 2nd a Vertical Slice in C++ with SFML (help) and that final year we did an entire game that we could release on Stores if we wanted.
										<br> That last one was my favourite project to work on so far, the game is currently "finished" albeit a bit buggy sometimes but got an Award and is even in the Games list in the Portfolio (<a href=GamePages/PortalDash.html>Portal Dash!</a> to be precise).

								<p>
									I am someone curious in general, I like to see how something works I like to help when needed, collaboration in a team isn't an issue and language barrier is far from my problem.
									<br> I am bilingual in English, and French is my native language, I recently passed the TOEIC test and got 940 points out of 990. I know also a bit of Japanese and Spanish.
									<br>I'm also a techy guy. You got a problem with your PC software / hardware wise ? No worries I can fix that for you. Need to build a new computer ? Message me and I'll see what suits you the best

								<h2>Why Programming?</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="CategoryBody">
								<p>
									Like I mentioned above I started using a PC at 7, around 2 years later a friend showed me a small game that not a lot of players know called Minecraft, and I immediately fell in love with the game.
									<br> While in college we decided with some friends to create a minecraft server, I wasn't good at programming in Java at that time (nor am I now but that can be fixed) but we managed to do a simple plugin that teleported you to another world when you walked somewhere.
									<br> Around the same time I began learning scratch in Math class, I was so good at it that I did the corrections for the others. And I also found out about Scrap Mechanic, where you can create complex machines with Logic Gates (aka coding with 0s and 1s) and did some really complex stuff
									<br> Around the last year of high school we had as projects to build games using an Arduino Card, basic stuff but I learnt some basic knowledge in C that way.
									<br> Back when Monster Hunter Generation released I was thrilled to know how Capcom created such an amazing game, I loved it so much that I dumped around 800 hours in one save, that game alone was with Minecraft the 2 games that made me go "I want to be a game dev to understand how that works and how a game like that is created, and one day release my own"
